### Business Context
The advent of e-news, or electronic news, portals has offered us a great opportunity to quickly get updates on day-to-day events occurring globally. Information on these portals is retrieved electronically from online databases, processed using a variety of software, and then transmitted to users. There are multiple advantages of transmitting new electronically, like faster access to content and ability to utilize different technologies such as audio, graphics, video, and other interactive elements that are either not being used or arenâ€™t common yet in traditional newspapers.
E-news Express, an online news portal, aims to expand its business by acquiring new subscribers. With every visitor to the website taking certain actions based on their interest, the company plans to analyze these actions to understand user interests and determine how to drive better engagement. The executives at E-news Express are of the opinion that there has been a decline in new monthly subscribers compared to the past year because the current webpage is not designed well enough in terms of outline & recommended content to keep customers engaged long enough to make a decision to subscribe.

### Problem statement and objective
The design team of the company has researched and created a new landing page that has a new outline & more relevant content shown compared to the old page. In order to test the effectiveness of the new landing page in gathering new subscribers, the Data Science team conducted an experiment by randomly selecting 100 users and dividing them equally into two groups. The existing landing page was served to the first group (control group) and the new landing page to the second group (treatment group). Data regarding the interaction of users in both groups with the two versions of the landing page was collected. Being a data scientist in E-news Express, you have been asked to explore the data and perform a statistical analysis (at a significance level of 5%) to determine the effectiveness of the new landing page in gathering new subscribers for the news portal by answering the following questions:

Do users spend more time on new landing page than on existing landing page?

Is conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the landing page and get converted) for new page greater than conversion rate for old page?

Does converted status depend on preferred language?

Is time spent on new page the same for different language users?
